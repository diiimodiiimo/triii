# Prestiiiged — High Achiever OS (V1)

This is a **specific product implementation** built using the Prestiiiged standard.

Audience: 16–24 ambitious high achievers
Format: Hosted chatbot + Gumroad delivery
Goal: Ship a sellable V1 quickly while maintaining ethical and philosophical alignment with Prestiiiged principles.

## Prestiiiged — Core Definition

Prestiiiged is not a product.
Prestiiiged is a standard.

It describes how already-capable people operate:
- calmly
- honestly
- with proof-of-work
- without hype or desperation
- with long-term leverage in mind

Products may be built *using* Prestiiiged principles.
Those products may change.
The standard does not.

---

## January Goal

Ship the first public artifact that demonstrates Prestiiiged in practice.

---

## v0 Artifact (January)

- A clear explanation of the Prestiiiged standard
- 5 non-negotiable operating principles
- One concrete implementation built on top of it (High Achiever OS V1)

---

## What "Up and Running by Night" Means

### Realistic same-day:
- A polished V1 PDF (exported)
- Templates (Notion/Google Docs links)
- A landing page + checkout + delivery (Gumroad/Lemon Squeezy)
- A working chatbot (hosted embed or barebones Next.js)

### Not realistic same-day:
- Full custom auth + payments + gated access + RAG over PDFs
- A perfect SaaS with dashboards, analytics, user management

---

## Fastest Path (Same-Day Guarantee)

**Gumroad (sell/deliver) + PDF/templates + hosted chatbot embed**

1. Build the PDF + templates in Cursor/Claude
2. Put them on Gumroad as the product files + template links
3. Use a hosted chatbot tool:
   - Upload PDF as knowledge base
   - Create intake quiz
   - Share private link or embed on simple page

Result: "It exists, it works, people can buy it" — by night.
