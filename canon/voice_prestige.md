# Prestiiiged Voice Contract

---

## 1. What Prestiiiged Is

Prestiiiged is a system for people who are done consuming and ready to build. It exists for the person who has ideas rotting in notes apps, half-finished projects scattered across folders, and a growing gap between who they are and who they know they could be. Prestiiiged closes that gap through structured execution, not motivation.

**For:**
- Builders who ship alone
- People allergic to hustle culture but still hungry
- Anyone who needs structure without surveillance

**Not for:**
- People looking for accountability coaches
- Productivity tourists who collect systems
- Anyone wanting to feel busy instead of be effective

---

## 2. Tone & Personality

**How it speaks:**
- Direct. No preamble.
- Concise. Every word earns its place.
- Calm confidence. Never desperate, never loud.
- Assumes intelligence. Doesn't over-explain.

**What it avoids:**
- Fake urgency ("Don't miss out!")
- Hustle porn ("Grind now, rest later")
- Generic motivation ("You've got this!")
- Corporate fluff ("Leverage synergies")
- Exclamation marks as energy substitutes

**Emotional posture:**
Quiet authority. The voice of someone who has shipped before and will ship again. Not a hype man. Not a therapist. A peer who respects your time.

## 3. Decision Principles

**How Prestiiiged chooses what to build:**
- Does this remove friction from shipping?
- Does this compound over time?
- Can this be explained in one sentence?

**How it prioritizes:**
1. Core loop first (the thing users do daily)
2. Reduction before addition
3. Defaults over options

**What gets explicitly rejected:**
- Features that require tutorials
- Dashboards for dashboards' sake
- Gamification that patronizes
- Social features bolted on for engagement
- Anything that adds cognitive load without clear payoff

---

## 4. Writing Style Rules

**Sentence length:**
- Short default. Under 15 words when possible.
- Longer sentences only for rhythm or necessary complexity.

**Bullets vs paragraphs:**
- Bullets for lists, options, and scannable content.
- Paragraphs for narrative or emotional weight.
- Never bullet a single item.

**Formatting:**
- Sentence case for headings.
- No all-caps unless ironic.
- Bold for emphasis, sparingly.
- No italics for sarcasm.

**Punctuation:**
- Periods over exclamation marks.
- Em dashes for interruption or pivot.
- No ellipses to trail off…

## 5. Product Constraints

**Prestiiiged will never:**
- Promise results it can't deliver
- Use dark patterns to retain users
- Guilt users for inactivity
- Sell user data or attention
- Pretend productivity is a personality
- Add features to match competitors

**Ethical boundaries:**
- No manufactured urgency
- No streaks that punish breaks
- No language implying failure for choosing rest
- No comparison mechanics between users

## 6. Examples

**Landing page headline:**
> Ship your work. Forget the system.

**In-app message (after completing a task):**
> Done. What's next?
