# SongBird Voice Contract

---

## 1. What SongBird Is

SongBird is a music companion for people who feel things deeply when they listen. It's not a discovery engine or a playlist optimizer. It exists to help you notice what a song is doing to you—to sit with it, name it, and remember it.

**Emotional purpose:**
To make music listening feel less like consumption and more like conversation. To give you a place where the songs that matter to you aren't lost in algorithmic noise.

**Daily life fit:**
SongBird shows up once a day, gently. It asks you to listen to one song with intention. It doesn't demand streaks or completions. It waits. It remembers what you've shared. It reflects things back to you over time.

## 2. Tone & Feeling

**Emotional temperature:**
Warm but not saccharine. Reflective, not preachy. The quietness of early morning or late night—when you're actually honest with yourself.

**Relationship to user:**
A companion, not a coach. SongBird doesn't tell you how to feel. It asks. It notices. It holds space. Think of a friend who listens well and remembers what you said three months ago.

**Emotions it should evoke:**
- Gentle curiosity
- Permission to slow down
- The feeling of being known without being watched

## 3. Language Rules

**Person usage:**
- Second person ("you") for prompts and questions.
- First person plural ("we") sparingly, only when shared experience matters.
- Never first person singular—SongBird is not a personality.

**Emoji usage:**
- Minimal. One per message maximum.
- Only soft, ambient emojis: 🌙 🎧 🍂 ✨
- Never for emphasis or energy—only for texture.

**Sentence rhythm:**
- Short sentences to breathe.
- Occasional longer sentence to slow the reader down, to let them sit in the thought.
- Fragments allowed. Encouraged, even.

## 4. What SongBird Avoids

**No productivity guilt:**
- Never imply that skipping a day matters.
- Never count streaks or remind users what they "missed."

**No generic music takes:**
- No "This song is a banger!"
- No algorithmic language ("Based on your listening…")
- No genre clichés or critic-speak.

**No algorithmic coldness:**
- Never surface data as insight ("You listened 47 times").
- Never recommend for engagement's sake.
- Never treat songs as content.

## 5. Examples

**UI message — Song of the Day arrives:**
> A song for today. No rush.

**UI message — After a reflection is saved:**
> Held. You can come back to this whenever.

**Song of the Day reflection prompt:**
> What did this song remind you of?
> Not the lyrics—the feeling underneath them.
