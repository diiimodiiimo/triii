## Problem Section

### Headline

```
You're already capable. The gap isn't talent.
```

### Body

```
You've read the advice. Done the networking. Followed the playbooks.

But something still feels off.

The people who get into elite rooms don't seem to be trying as hard. They're not grinding 18-hour days or "crushing it." They're calm. They're positioned. They're obviously hard to ignore.

That's not luck. It's operating rhythm.

Most advice tells you to work harder, reach out more, or "put yourself out there."

This tells you the truth: prestige doors open easiest when you don't need them to.

## Principles Preview Section

### Headline

```
The 5 Principles
```

### List

```
1. Control the emotional temperature of the room
   Your job isn't to perform — it's to make the other person feel at ease saying yes.

2. Earn leverage before you ask for access
   What proof makes this conversation obvious?

3. Tell the truth, strategically
   Your story is not your entire life — it's the signal you send.

4. Be dangerous at one thing
   If you can't state your dangerous skill in one sentence, you haven't chosen it yet.

5. Play long games with short feedback loops
   Every week must produce something concrete: output, proof, or signal.

Questions
```

### Q&As

```
Q: Is this another productivity system?
A: No. This is about positioning, not productivity. It's about operating with calm leverage — not optimizing your to-do list.

Q: Who is this for?
A: Students and early professionals aiming for elite outcomes — Goldman, McKinsey, top schools, competitive programs. People who are already capable but need the operating rhythm.

Q: What if I'm not applying to anything right now?
A: The principles compound over time. Start now and you'll have leverage when you need it — instead of scrambling to build it.

Q: Is there a refund policy?
A: If it doesn't resonate within 7 days, email me and I'll refund you. No questions.

Q: What format is it in?
A: PDF for the main guide. Markdown/Notion-compatible templates. Web-based AI advisor.
